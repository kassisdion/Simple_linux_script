# Technical choice
I've decided to make my project in python with the web framework flask (see http://flask.pocoo.org/).

# Requirement
If you want to run the server, you have to install the dependencies.
You can install them by running script/install_dependencies.sh (the script will install 'python', 'pip' and 'flask')
